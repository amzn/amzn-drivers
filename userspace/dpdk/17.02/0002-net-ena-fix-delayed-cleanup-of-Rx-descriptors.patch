Subject: [PATCH 2/6] net/ena: fix delayed cleanup of Rx descriptors

[ upstream commit ec78af6bc0556cf2a1133185ca33fb835b38afe0 ]

On RX path, after receiving bunch of packets, variable tracking
available descriptors in HW queue was not updated.

To fix this issue, variable tracking used descriptors must be updated
after receiving packets - it must be reduced by the amount of received
descriptors in current batch.

Additionally, variable next_to_clean in rx_ring must be updated before
entering ena_populate_rx_queue() to keep it up to date with the current
ring state.

Fixes: 1daff5260ff8 ("net/ena: use unmasked head and tail")
