Subject: [PATCH 013/107] docs: update ENA PMD documentation and features

Previously, the features list was indicating unsupported ENA PMD
features and were missing few ones, that were actually supported.

The features file was updated, so it is now reflecting current driver
state.

The documentation was updated with the more actual example and features,
especially ones which are ENA and not listed in the features file.
