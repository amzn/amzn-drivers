Subject: [PATCH 47/72] doc: mark Armv8 as supported by ENA PMD

The ARMv8 platform support was tested and works fine with the ENA PMD.

It can be used on the AWS a1.* and m6g.* instances.

The ARMv8 support in ENA is at least from v19.11, where the VFIO DPDK
driver was fixed to work with 32-bit applications compiled for arm.
